## ResolverStrategy.getResolveRoot() method

Get the logical resolve root for a given uri.

For example, a filesystem-based strategy might consider the root to be `file:///`<!-- -->. Or, if it was scoped to /home/filearts, the root might be `file:///home/filearts/`<!-- -->.

Any uri that is not a 'child' of the resolve root should be considered out of scope for a given strategy.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getResolveRoot(ctx: ResolverContext, uri: Uri): MaybeThenable<ResolverStrategy.ResolveRootResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  ctx | ResolverContext | A <code>ResolverContext</code> that should be used for making calls to other strategy methods |
|  uri | Uri | The uri for which the logical resolve root uri should be found |

<b>Returns:</b>

MaybeThenable&lt;ResolverStrategy.ResolveRootResult&gt;
