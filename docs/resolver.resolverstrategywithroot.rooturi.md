## ResolverStrategyWithRoot.rootUri property

The root uri of the strategy.

A common parent to all uris that this strategy can handle.

This may sometimes be the same value as would be returned by `getResolveRoot` but will sometimes be a parent of that. Take, for example Unpkg; there, we may want to express that a strategy should 'own' all uris under https://unpkg.com/ even though the resolve root for https://unpkg.com/react<!-- -->@<!-- -->16.13.1/index.js will actually be https://unpkg.com/react<!-- -->@<!-- -->16.13.1/.

Notably, the `CompoundResolverStrategy` requires all child strategies implement the `ResolverStrategyWithRoot` interface because it dispatches operations on different uris according to each strategy's `rootUri`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
rootUri: Uri;
```
