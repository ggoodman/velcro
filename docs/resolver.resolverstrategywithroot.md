## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [rootUri](./resolver.resolverstrategywithroot.rooturi.md) | Uri | The root uri of the strategy.<!-- -->A common parent to all uris that this strategy can handle.<!-- -->This may sometimes be the same value as would be returned by <code>getResolveRoot</code> but will sometimes be a parent of that. Take, for example Unpkg; there, we may want to express that a strategy should 'own' all uris under https://unpkg.com/ even though the resolve root for https://unpkg.com/react<!-- -->@<!-- -->16.13.1/index.js will actually be https://unpkg.com/react<!-- -->@<!-- -->16.13.1/.<!-- -->Notably, the <code>CompoundResolverStrategy</code> requires all child strategies implement the <code>ResolverStrategyWithRoot</code> interface because it dispatches operations on different uris according to each strategy's <code>rootUri</code>. |
