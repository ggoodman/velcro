## ResolverStrategy.getCanonicalUrl() method

Determine the canonical uri for a given uri.

For example, you might consider symlink targets their canonicalized path or you might consider the canonicalized path of https://unpkg.com/react to be https://unpkg.com/react<!-- -->@<!-- -->16.13.1/index.js.

Dealing only in canonical uris means that anything produced from those can be cached.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getCanonicalUrl(ctx: ResolverContext, uri: Uri): MaybeThenable<ResolverStrategy.CanonicalizeResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  ctx | ResolverContext | A <code>ResolverContext</code> that should be used for making calls to other strategy methods |
|  uri | Uri | The uri to canonicalize |

<b>Returns:</b>

MaybeThenable&lt;ResolverStrategy.CanonicalizeResult&gt;
